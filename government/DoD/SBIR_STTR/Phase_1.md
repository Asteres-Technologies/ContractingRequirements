12. **Technical Data Rights.** 
    - [Rights in technical data, including software, developed under the terms of any contract resulting from proposals submitted in response to this BAA generally remain with the contractor, except that the Government obtains a royalty-free license to use such technical data only for Government purposes during the period commencing with contract award and ending twenty years after completion of the project under which the data were generated. This data must be marked with the restrictive legend specified in DFARS 252.227-7018 Class Deviation 2020-O0007. Upon expiration of the twenty-year restrictive license, the Government has unlimited rights in the SBIR data. During the license period, the Government may not release or disclose SBIR data to any person other than its support services contractors except: (1) For evaluation purposes; (2) As expressly permitted by the contractor; or (3) A use, release, or disclosure that is necessary for emergency repair or overhaul of items operated by the Government. See DFARS clause 252.227-7018 Class Deviation 2020-O0007 "Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software – Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program."

    If a proposer plans to submit assertions in accordance with DFARS 252.227-7017 Class Deviation 2020-O0007, those assertions must be identified and assertion of use, release, or disclosure restriction MUST be included with your proposal submission. The contract cannot be awarded until assertions have been approved. Please note that only the table is included in the page limitation; any supporting data concerning the contract/grant number and awarding agency, as well as planned use or need of the data asserted, can be provided in Volume 5, Supporting Documents.

    The following instructions apply to the fields in the table below (Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Technical Data or Computer Software).
    1) For technical data (other than computer software documentation) pertaining to items, components, or processes developed at private expense, identify both the deliverable technical data and each such item, component, or process.  For computer software or computer software documentation identify the software or documentation.
    2) Generally, development at private expense, either exclusively or partially, is the only basis for asserting restrictions.  For technical data, other than computer software documentation, development refers to development of the item, component, or process to which the data pertain.  The Government's rights in computer software documentation generally may not be restricted.  For computer software, development refers to the software.  Indicate whether development was accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.  If development was not accomplished at private expense, or for computer software documentation, enter the specific basis for asserting restrictions.
    3) Enter asserted rights category (e.g., Government purpose license rights from a prior contract, rights in SBIR/STTR data generated under another contract, limited, restricted, or government purpose rights under this or a prior contract, or specially negotiated licenses).
    4) Corporation, individual, or other person, as appropriate.
    5) Enter “none” when all data or software will be submitted without restrictions.]

13. **Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Technical Data or Computer Software**
    The Offeror asserts for itself, or the persons identified below, that the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose the following technical data or computer software should be restricted:

    | Technical Data or Computer Software to be Furnished with Restrictions | Basis for Assertion | Asserted Rights Category | Name of Person or Organization Asserting Restrictions |
