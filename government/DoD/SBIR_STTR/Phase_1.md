### PHASE I TEMPLATE – VOLUME 2: TECHNICAL VOLUME

These instructions and template apply to the Department of Defense (DoD) Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) Phase I topics and provide general guidelines for completing the Phase I Technical Volume. Information provided in the Component-specific instructions for the topic of interest take precedence over any instructions listed below.

The template (beginning on the following page) is the format model that may be used to prepare the Phase I Technical Volume. Do not include the instructions provided on this page or any [bracketed guidance] in the template.

#### Disclosure  
Offerors that include in their proposals data which they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, must:
1. Mark the first page of each Volume of the Submission with the following legend:
   > "This proposal includes data that must not be disclosed outside the Government and must not be duplicated, used, or disclosed-in whole or in part-for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of-or in connection with-the submission of this data, the Government has the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in pages [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]"; 
2. Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: 
   > "Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the first page of this volume."

#### Format  
The Technical Volume shall meet the following requirements:
- Please refer to Component-specific instructions for the topic of interest for the page limit and for how a technical volume is handled if the stated page count is exceeded. It is the proposing firm’s responsibility to verify that the Technical Volume does not exceed the page limit after upload to DSIP. Unless otherwise noted, all content in the Technical Volume will count toward the limit.
- Single column format, single-spaced typed lines.
- Standard 8 ½” x 11” paper format.
- Page margins one-inch on all sides. A header and footer may be included in the one-inch margin.
- The header on each page of the Technical Volume should contain your company name, topic number, and proposal number assigned by the Defense SBIR/STTR Innovation Portal (DSIP) site when the Cover Sheet was created.
- No font smaller than 10-point. For headers, footers, imbedded tables, figures, images, or graphics that include text, a font size of smaller than 10-point is allowable, though proposers are cautioned that the text may be unreadable by evaluators.

For these individuals, please specify their country of origin, the type of visa or work permit under which they are performing and an explanation of their anticipated level of involvement on this project. Proposers frequently assume that individuals with dual citizenship or a work permit will be permitted to work on an SBIR project and do not report them. This is not necessarily the case and a proposal will be rejected if the requested information is not provided. Therefore, firms should report any and all individuals expected to be involved on this project that are considered a foreign national as defined in the DoD SBIR/STTR Broad Agency Announcement. You may be asked to provide additional information during negotiations in order to verify the foreign citizen’s eligibility to participate on a SBIR contract. Supplemental information provided in response to this paragraph will be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), if applicable, and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6)). Note: If no foreign nationals will be involved in proposed work, the word “None” can be substituted for the table.]

Justify equipment purchases in this section and include detailed pricing information in the Cost Volume. State whether or not the facilities where the proposed work will be performed meet environmental laws and regulations of federal, state (name), and local Governments for, but not limited to, the following groupings: airborne emissions, waterborne effluents, external radiation levels, outdoor noise, solid and bulk waste disposal practices, and handling and storage of toxic and hazardous materials.]  
10. **Subcontractors/Consultants.**  
    - [Propose efforts as applicable to either SBIR or STTR as follows:
        - **SBIR.** Involvement of a university or other subcontractors or consultants in the project may be appropriate. A minimum of two-thirds of the research and/or analytical work in Phase I, as measured by direct and indirect costs, must be carried out by the proposing small business firm, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. SBIR efforts may include subcontracts with Federal Laboratories and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs). A waiver is no longer required for the use of Federal Laboratories and FFRDCs; however, proposers must certify their use of such facilities in Volume 1: Proposal Cover Sheet. Subcontracts with other Federal organizations are not permitted. Note that universities cannot publically release information related to Export Controlled/ITAR restricted topics. (Refer to the DoD SBIR/STTR Broad Agency Announcement for detailed eligibility requirements as it pertains to the use of subcontractors/consultants.) 
        - **STTR.** Involvement of a Research Institution in the project is required. A minimum of 40% of the research and/or analytical work in Phase I, as measured by direct and indirect costs, must be conducted by the proposing small business firm, and a minimum of 30% of the research and/or tasks in Phase I, as measured by direct and indirect costs, must be conducted by a single Research Institution. STTR efforts may include subcontracts with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs). A waiver is no longer required for the use of Federal Laboratories but they do not qualify as a Research Partner; proposers may only subcontract to Federal Laboratories within the remaining 30% and must certify their use of such facilities in Volume 1: Proposal Cover Sheet. Subcontracts with other Federal organizations are not permitted. Note that universities cannot publically release information related to Export Controlled/ITAR restricted topics. (Refer to the DoD SBIR/STTR Broad Agency Announcement for detailed eligibility requirements as it pertains to the use of subcontractors/consultants.)]

11. **Prior, Current or Pending Support of Similar Proposals or Awards.**
    - [If a proposal submitted in response to this BAA is substantially the same as another proposal that was funded, is now being funded, or is pending with another Federal Agency, or another DoD Component or DARPA, you must reveal this on Volume 1: Proposal Cover Sheet and provide the following information:
        - a) Name and address of the Federal Agency(s) or DoD Component to which a proposal was submitted, will be submitted, or from which an award is expected or has been received.

        - f) If award was received, provide contract number.
        - g) Specify the applicable topics for each proposal submitted or award received.
    - Note: If this does not apply, state in the proposal "No prior, current, or pending support has been provided for proposed work."]

12. **Technical Data Rights.** 
    - [Rights in technical data, including software, developed under the terms of any contract resulting from proposals submitted in response to this BAA generally remain with the contractor, except that the Government obtains a royalty-free license to use such technical data only for Government purposes during the period commencing with contract award and ending twenty years after completion of the project under which the data were generated. This data must be marked with the restrictive legend specified in DFARS 252.227-7018 Class Deviation 2020-O0007. Upon expiration of the twenty-year restrictive license, the Government has unlimited rights in the SBIR data. During the license period, the Government may not release or disclose SBIR data to any person other than its support services contractors except: (1) For evaluation purposes; (2) As expressly permitted by the contractor; or (3) A use, release, or disclosure that is necessary for emergency repair or overhaul of items operated by the Government. See DFARS clause 252.227-7018 Class Deviation 2020-O0007 "Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software – Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program."

    If a proposer plans to submit assertions in accordance with DFARS 252.227-7017 Class Deviation 2020-O0007, those assertions must be identified and assertion of use, release, or disclosure restriction MUST be included with your proposal submission. The contract cannot be awarded until assertions have been approved. Please note that only the table is included in the page limitation; any supporting data concerning the contract/grant number and awarding agency, as well as planned use or need of the data asserted, can be provided in Volume 5, Supporting Documents.

    The following instructions apply to the fields in the table below (Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Technical Data or Computer Software).
    1) For technical data (other than computer software documentation) pertaining to items, components, or processes developed at private expense, identify both the deliverable technical data and each such item, component, or process.  For computer software or computer software documentation identify the software or documentation.
    2) Generally, development at private expense, either exclusively or partially, is the only basis for asserting restrictions.  For technical data, other than computer software documentation, development refers to development of the item, component, or process to which the data pertain.  The Government's rights in computer software documentation generally may not be restricted.  For computer software, development refers to the software.  Indicate whether development was accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.  If development was not accomplished at private expense, or for computer software documentation, enter the specific basis for asserting restrictions.
    3) Enter asserted rights category (e.g., Government purpose license rights from a prior contract, rights in SBIR/STTR data generated under another contract, limited, restricted, or government purpose rights under this or a prior contract, or specially negotiated licenses).
    4) Corporation, individual, or other person, as appropriate.
    5) Enter “none” when all data or software will be submitted without restrictions.]

13. **Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Technical Data or Computer Software**
    The Offeror asserts for itself, or the persons identified below, that the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose the following technical data or computer software should be restricted:

    | Technical Data or Computer Software to be Furnished with Restrictions | Basis for Assertion | Asserted Rights Category | Name of Person or Organization Asserting Restrictions |
